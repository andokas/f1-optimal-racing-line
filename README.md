# F1 Optimal Racing Line

Machine learning approach to predict optimal racing lines in Formula 1 circuits. 

## 🎯 Objective
Develop a universal model that learns racing patterns from real F1 telemetry data (2018-2025) and predicts optimal trajectories across different circuits and regulation eras.

## 📊 Data Sources
- FastF1: Official F1 telemetry data
- OpenF1: Additional race data
- TracingInsights: Visual reference

## 🧠 Model
LSTM-based architecture with circuit and regulation era embeddings for cross-circuit generalization.

## 🚧 Status
Work in progress - TFG (Bachelor's Thesis) project
